## Summary

NASA and space exploration is an exciting field of study, and NASA’s Psyche mission is one of the latest operations that hopes to uncover some of the mysteries of our solar system. Psyche is a metal-rich asteroid in the asteroid belt, and by studying it, scientists hope to learn more about planetary cores and the early stages of planet formation. It's a crucial mission to gain an understanding of the cosmos, but unfortunately, its complexity deters interest from the general public and people don't understand the challenges it faces. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing AR and WebXR experiences to bring Psyche’s story to life for everyone, including those who aren’t scientists (Psyche Mission FAQ, 2023).

Professor Cassie Bowman, the project sponsor from ASU, hopes to display this AR/WebXR experience in museums, where visitors like kids and families can dive into a virtual orbit around Psyche! After scanning a QR code with their smartphones, museum guests can interact with a large 3D-printed model of the asteroid, exploring its surface and gathering data as if they were part of the mission. Visitors will also have the option to enjoy other experiences like a virtual scavenger hunt! This hands-on experience aims to make learning about Psyche accessible and engaging, taking museum interactions to another level (NASA, 2021).


## Projects

All projects mentioned below use the following tech stack: AFrame, Blender

### Mission to Psyche: 
AR/WebXR experience that puts you inside the spacecraft and shows you facts about the mission in an interactive way.

Primarily developed by: Santiago Blanco

### The Psyche Trivia Wheel:
WebXR experience that lets users study key facts about the mission, then quiz themselves by spinning a digital wheel filled with trivia topics.

Primarily developed by: Adonias Daniel

### Psyche Space Hunt:
WebXR experience that makes users click through various items relating to the mission in a scavenger hunt style. When you collect an item, quick facts about it pop up.
