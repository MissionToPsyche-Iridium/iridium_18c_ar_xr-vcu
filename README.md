Project 25-320 NASA [Psyche Mission](https://psyche.asu.edu/)

NASA and ASU are conducting research on a metal rich asteroid named “Psyche”
Because of the complexity of the information, we were tasked with creating WebXR and VR experiences to educate the public about the mission

Demo created with A-Frame

Deployed on Github pages: https://ssantiagoblancoo.github.io/psyche-aframe/

## Immerse Into Psyche:
AR/WebXR experience that puts you inside the spacecraft and shows you facts about the mission in an interactive way. User will be greeted with a title screen regarding the name of the mission, once they click on the screen they will be transported into the first WebXR screen in which they can read a summary of three major things regarding the mission: The Psyche Mission, The Asteroid, and The Spacecraft. After interacting with this screen user can click Explore Psyche Button, which will take them inside the spacecraft to read upon more detailed information regarding the mission. Interacting with objects inside the spacecraft will create an engaging learning experience towards the user.

## Overall Project Summary

NASA and space exploration is an exciting field of study, and NASA’s Psyche mission is one of the latest operations that hopes to uncover some of the mysteries of our solar system. Psyche is a metal-rich asteroid in the asteroid belt, and by studying it, scientists hope to learn more about planetary cores and the early stages of planet formation. It's a crucial mission to gain an understanding of the cosmos, but unfortunately, its complexity deters interest from the general public and people don't understand the challenges it faces. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing AR and WebXR experiences to bring Psyche’s story to life for everyone, including those who aren’t scientists (Psyche Mission FAQ, 2023).

Professor Cassie Bowman, the project sponsor from ASU, hopes to display this AR/WebXR experience in museums, where visitors like kids and families can dive into a virtual orbit around Psyche! After scanning a QR code with their smartphones, museum guests can interact with a large 3D-printed model of the asteroid, exploring its surface and gathering data as if they were part of the mission. Visitors will also have the option to enjoy other experiences like a virtual scavenger hunt! This hands-on experience aims to make learning about Psyche accessible and engaging, taking museum interactions to another level (NASA, 2021).
